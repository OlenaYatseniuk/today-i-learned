Today I learned some information about GIT 
Learned some  GIT's commands:
- ls (list)- show all the files in directory or someone else;
- cd - open the directory you want (you need to write a way to this directory) (or( cd nameofDirectory))
- cd .. - on 1 directory up
git init - initialized empty git repository
ls -a -show you all directory, even unvisible, such as .git
git status - show have you commit now or not yet
git add NameDirectory - add to git
git commit - add commit
